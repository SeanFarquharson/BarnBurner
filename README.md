Analyzing National Hockey League (NHL) Draft Data

The annual NHL draft if one of the most impotant times of the year for each and every team in the NHL. There are 7 rounds with 32 players selected in each round, for a total of 224 players. Each and every selection is of extreme importance and will have a great impact on the success of the teams moving forward. These players can be developed into full-time NHL players, the players or the draft pick may be traded, or the player draftd may never get the chance to play in the league.

Some of the greatest players to have played in the NHL have been selected in later rounds of the NHL draft. As a result, there is much work to be done in terms of selecting players in the NHL draft. In this project, we will work toward identifying key features that describe a "successful" NHL draft pick. We use historical NHL draft data that was uploaded as an open source to GitHub by Oliver Schulte.
